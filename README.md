# Fedi for Pleroma and Mastodon
[![Translate - with Weblate](https://img.shields.io/badge/translate%20with-Weblate-green.svg?style=flat)](https://translate.pleroma.social/engage/fedi-app/) 

Fedi is open-source client for [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) social networks written using Flutter.

Pleroma and Mastodon are parts of [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) (decentralized social network). Main idea of Fediverse - nobody owns Fediverse. Anybody can run their own server instance and use it to communicate with other people.

So Fedi is an open-source mobile client for social networks and has features similar to Twitter.

## Data gathering

Fedi don't use any special analytics service to track users. 
However Fedi uses Firebase services for PushNotifications(optional) and CrashReporting(optional).

You can completely remove Firebase via manual building from source. 

### Crash reports via Firebase Crashlytics

Fedi gathers crashes and non-fatal errors to make app more stable.

* You can build app from source and remove Crashlytics library via .env config(details below)
* You can disable gathering via settings inside app(option disabled by default)

## Push notifications

Push notifications implemented via [PushRelayFCM](https://github.com/Big-Fig/toot-relay-fcm) server

[PushRelayFCM](https://github.com/Big-Fig/toot-relay-fcm) is Ruby on Rails server which handle web pushes and relay them to FCM.

**From `2.5.0` version Fedi uses PushRelayFCM mode without decryption on server-side. So all private data is safe.**

PushRelayFCM and Fedi can work in two modes:
* **Without server-side decryption (`2.5.0` and newer)** - relay simple proxy encrypted messages
* **With server-side decryption (before `2.5.0`)** -decrypt messages and have access to notification content and user `access_token`. Not used from `2.5.0` version, but still supported in Fedi(see below why you still may want to use it).

### Without server-side decryption way
**(Used in AppStore/GooglePlay versions from `2.5.0`)**

1. Fedi subscribe to `/api/v1/push/subscription` with `subscription[endpoint]` set to relay server URL
2. Instances send web push notifications to relay server
3. PushRelayFCM **don't decrypt** message
4. PushRelayFCM proxy notifications to Fedi app via FCM
5. Fedi **don't decrypt** message and use FCM message with encrypted data as simple trigger to load latest notification via REST API (this will be improved in future releases)
6. Fedi display notification

Since PushRelayServer don't know private decryption keys, it is can't access any privacy data.

##### Pros
* **Don't have access to user private data**
* Use rich notifications layouts and actions provided by [`awesome_notifications`](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications)

##### Cons
* Delivery may be delayed. Because PushRelayFCM send FCM push message without `notification` (FCM calls it data message). Read [`awesome_notifications`](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications) and [`firebase_messaging`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) documentation for details. Fedi use `:mutable_content=>true,` `:content_available=>true,` `:priority=>"high",` to increase delivery priority

##### Whe Fedi don't decrypt message on client-side?

Because it is hard to implement with Flutter. There are no 3rd Flutter libraries to decrypt `ECDH` `p256v1` by now. 
It is possible to decrypt in Kotlin/Swift and it will be done in the future.

### With server-side decryption way
**(Not used in AppStore/GooglePlay versions from `2.5.0`)**

1. Fedi subscribe to `/api/v1/push/subscription` with `subscription[endpoint]` set to relay server URL
2. Instances send Web push notifications to relay server
3. PushRelayFCM **decrypt** notifications
4. PushRelayFCM relay notifications to Fedi app via FCM
5. Fedi display notification

* PushRelayFCM have access to `title`, `body` and `access_token`
* `access_token` is sensitive data. It is possible to login to your account if someone know `access_token`

##### Pros
* Faster push delivery. FCM message(notification type) with `notification.title` and `notification.body`. Which have higher priority than message without `notification.title` & `notification.body` fields. Actually it is more affects iOS, than Android. Read [`awesome_notifications`](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications) and [`firebase_messaging`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) documentation for details.

##### Cons
* **Private data access is main reason why Fedi moved to `Without server-side decryption way`**
* Don't use rich notifications layouts and actions provided by [`awesome_notifications`](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications)

## Localization

App uses `flutter_localization` API bundle with Flutter SDK. 

It uses `.arb` files located in `lib/l10n` and generates `.dart` classes in `/lib/generated/` folder.

After you make changes in `.arb` files you make additional actions to regenerate Dart classes
* automatically via [`flutter intl`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl) plugin
* manually via [`flutter intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_utils) package

### Completed

* English, Russian

### Help translate Fedi

## Feedback

* The best option is to create issue for this repository

## For developers

* Null-safety support
* Feature-based folder structure
* Prefer composition over inheritance
* Dependency Injection implemented via `provider`
* Prefer `StatelessWidget` and async UI update via `StreamBuidler` and `BehaviourSubject` & `StreamController` in controller classes
* Prefer divide `Widgets` in small sub `Widgets` with `const` constructor(for better performance) if possible
* Provide data to nested elements via `provider`
* Prefer `Repository` pattern. Almost all network data cached in local SQLite database. UI always display data from single source. It may be network-only or from database(if data cached). Don't cache and merge data in memory to achieve data consistency
* Prefer [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) name and style code conventions
* Prefer long file & classes names like `account_follower_account_cached_list_bloc_impl.dart` and `AccountFollowerAccountCachedListBloc`
 * It easy to understand what class do
 * It easy to navigate in IDE by typing start letters of name
* One class = one file
* Prefer `interfaces` for `Bussines Logic` and `Services` 
 * Simple append `I` to implementation class name. `AccountFollowerAccountCachedListBloc` implementation and `IAccountFollowerAccountCachedListBloc` interface
 * Code readability: you can see small list of public methods/fields in interface file instead of exploring long file with implementations
 * It useful to implement extensions for interfaces not for implementations
 * It useful to extends several interfaces in one child to separate logic
 * It useful to create tests and mocks


### Flutter version & FVM 

To build Fedi you need Flutter version specified in [`.fvm/fvm_config.json`](.fvm/fvm_config.json) field `flutterSdkVersion`. 

You can achieve this by specifing your system Flutter version by using `flutter version $version` or using FVM

#### Flutter Version Management(FVM)

Fedi uses [Flutter Version Management](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm) to clearly specify Flutter version to build app.

FVM also helps manage several SDKs version on local machine

Config already done, so you just run `fvm install` in repo folder and configure IDE to use `.fvm/flutter_sdk` folder instead of system Flutter SDK. 

To use flutter version specified in `.fvm/fvm_config.json` you should prepend `fvm` like `fvm flutter install`

More info you can found in FVM documentation

### How to build from source

##### Clone repository

`git clone https://github.com/Big-Fig/Fediverse.app`

##### Go to repository folder

`cd Fediverse.app`

##### Install FVM

Install Flutter version used by this project

`fvm install`

##### Copy default .env config

Copy config for `prod` and `dev` flavors

```
cp env_example.env env_prod.env
cp env_example.env env_dev.env
```

Example config disable some features like **Push notifications**. 

To enable **all features** you should change app id, create [Firebase](#Firebase) project and edit config file.

##### Run

###### Run from command line

* Download all required libraries

```
fvm flutter pub get
```

* Run by Flavor

```
fvm flutter run --flavor dev
``` 

or

```
fvm flutter run --flavor prod
```

###### Run from IDE

* Specify **Flutter SDK path**
 * `File->Preferences->Languages & Frameworks->Flutter` to `<Project_Root>/.fvm/flutter_sdk`

![Config Flutter SDK](./images/config_flutter_sdk.png)

* Dart SDK should be configured automatically. But you can check **Dart SDK path** at (`File->Preferences->Languages & Frameworks->Dart`). Should be `<Project_Root>/.fvm/flutter_sdk/bin/cache/dart-sdk`

![Config Dart SDK](./images/config_dart_sdk.png)

* Specify flavor(`prod` or `dev`) in `Run Configurations`

```
Run->Edit configurations
```

![Run configurations](./images/run_configurations.png)

* Click `Pub get` in IDE or run `fvm pub get` in terminal
* Connect device or run emulator
* Run


#### Flavors

There are two flavors. 

*Implementation details:* [Build flavors in Flutter (Android and iOS) with different Firebase projects per flavor](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b)

###### prod

Used for production builds

###### dev

Used for development builds. You can use only prod flavor if you don't need special config for development

#### Config

Main purpose of config files is to exclude sensitive data from source control and quickly enabled/disable and config some features like Push Notifications

Build script uses config from project root folder depends on flavor, so to build app you should have next files in root folder

```
env_prod.env
env_dev.env
```

Those files excluded from source control.

You can find all possible config variables(with comments) at [env_example.env](https://github.com/Big-Fig/Fediverse.app/blob/master/env_example.env)

#### If you have strange errors in any case or how to clean project

* `fvm flutter clean` or `flutter clean` if you don't use FVM
* `./gradlew clean` in android folder
* `Product->Clean` in XCode
* `File(or Android Studio on Mac)->Invalidate caches & Restart` in Android Studio

Sometimes it also need to clear iOS pods

```
cd ios
rm -rf Pods
rm Podfile.lock
pod install
```

Sometimes you change package version in `pubspec.yaml` run `pub get` but version not changes

```
rm pubspec.lock
rm .flutter-plugins
rm .flutter-plugins-dependencies
rm .packages
rm -rf .dart_tool
pub get
```

Sometimes when you change package version in `pubspec.yaml` and after pub get version not changes. 
You can check `pubspec.lock` to see if version actually changed.
That may happens when you specify version bounds like `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` or `^1.0.0` which actually same. 
See [Version constraints](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#version-constraints) in official docs.

```
rm pubspec.lock
rm .flutter-plugins
rm .flutter-plugins-dependencies
rm .packages
rm -rf .dart_tool
pub get
```

Fedi specify explicitly version like `1.0.0` to avoid such issues. 
However, that may cause dependencies version conflict  

#### App ID

Changing App ID is required if you want to setup own PushRelayFCM server and pushes via your Firebase project for FCM. 

It also useful if you want to have several app versions installed on one device

Unfortunately, it is not possible to use APP_ID from config in all places in Gradle and XCode project files. So in some places ID is hardcoded

So, If you want to change app id from `com.fediverse.app` for `prod` and from `com.fediverse.app2` for `dev` you should manual changes (in additional to changes id in `.env` files)

Actually you should run Find and Replace `com.fediverse.app` with your package name on `ios` and `android` folders. And rename folders at `android/app/src/main/kotlin`

However, it may cause strange build errors. So you may need full clean

If you still have errors please explore App ID things in the next docs: 

* [Build flavors in Flutter (Android and iOS) with different Firebase projects per flavor](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b)
* [`flutter_config`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_config)  
* [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
* [`firebase_crashlytics`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_crashlytics)
* [`firebase_messaging`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging)
* [`receive_sharing_intent`](https://pub.dev/packages/receive_sharing_intent)

###### iOS group ids

* `receive_sharing_intent` lib require to add group.<app_id> to XCode project. 
Unfortunately it is not possible, due our internal issues (we moved app to new iTunes account and can't use old group id).
So we use [`fork of receive_sharing_intent`](https://github.com/xal/receive_sharing_intent/tree/xal/custom_group_id) with custom group ids support.

Fedi uses group `fediverse.app` for `prod` and `com.fediverse.app2` for `dev`  

#### Signing

###### Android

Signing config required to make `release` builds 

Generate key via [Tutorial](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) and put it in `android/key/key.jks`(exclude from source control)

Create `android/key.properties`(exclude from source control) file with next template.

```
storePassword=pass1
keyPassword=pass2
keyAlias=keyName
storeFile=../key/key.jks
```

###### iOS

Follow [official tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios)

#### Firebase

To use Firebase service you should generate files from your Firebase project page and put in project.

Don't forget to enable in `.env` file

`FIREBASE_ENABLED=false`

###### Android

* Generate `google-services.json`

Put `google-services.json` to folder depends on used flavor

* `android/app/src/dev`
* `android/app/src/prod`

###### iOS

* Generate `GoogleService-Info.plist`

Put `GoogleService-Info.plist` to folder depends on used flavor

* `ios/config/dev`
* `ios/config/prod`

For more details see

* [Flutter Firebase documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview) 
* [Build flavors in Flutter (Android and iOS) with different Firebase projects per flavor](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b)

#### Push notifications 

To enable Push notifications you should
* change [App ID](#App-ID)
* create Firebase Project for your App ID,
* generate [Firebase config and integrate in app](#Firebase)
* generate FCM server key
* setup own [PushRelayFCM](https://github.com/Big-Fig/toot-relay-fcm) server instance and put your FCM server key

App ID and FCM server key(so and PushRelayFCM instance) are connected. 
It is not possible to use one PushRelayFCM instance with several App IDs and vice versa

On/Off via .env. [Firebase Core integration](#Firebase) required

```
PUSH_FCM_ENABLED=false
```

##### Proxy PushRelayFCM

Required if `PUSH_FCM_ENABLED=true`

`PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEYS_P256DH `

User agent public key. Base64 encoded string of public key of ECDH key using prime256v1 curve.

`PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEYS_AUTH`

Auth secret. Base64 encoded string of 16 bytes of random data.

More info in [Mastodon docs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/push/) and [PushRelayFCM](https://github.com/Big-Fig/toot-relay-fcm) server docs

```
PUSH_FCM_RELAY_URL=https://pushrelay.example.com/push/
PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEYS_P256DH=BEpPCn0cfs3P0E0fY-gyOuahx5dW5N8qu
PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEYS_AUTH=T5bhIIyre5TDC
```

#### Firebase Crashlytics

On/Off via .env. [Firebase Core integration](#Firebase) required

```
CRASHLYTICS_ENABLED=false
```

Used to catch errors on client side with error description and stackTrace

You should enable [Firebase support](#Firebase) and change config variable in .env file to enable crash reporting

#### Versioning

###### Android

Uses version from `pubspec.yaml`

###### iOS

By default Flutter project config it should use version from `pubspec.yaml`,
However, sometimes it causes strange iOS build errors(version not changed but should).

So, Fedi requires manual increase version code & name in `Runner` and `Share Extension` targets. 

#### Receiving share intents & ShareExtension

XCode project have additional ShareExtension module required by [`receive_sharing_intent`](https://pub.dev/packages/receive_sharing_intent) to handle income share events.
It also important to add `Target` and `ShareExtension` to same group ID.
