## Data gathering

### Crash reports via Firebase Crashlytics

* You can build app from source and remove Crashlytics via .env config (details below)
* Option to disable Crashlytics gathering inside App **(coming soon)**


## Push notifications

Push notifications implemented via Web Push Relay (Proxy) server. 

Web Push Relay is Ruby on Rails server which handle Web pushes and proxy them to FCM.

* LINK TO PUSH RELAY REPO **(coming soon)**

1. Fedi subscribe to `/api/v1/push/subscription` with `subscription[endpoint]` set to proxy server.
2. Instances send Web push notifications to relay server.
3. Relay server proxy notifications to Fedi app via FCM
4. Fedi display notifications

* Notifications are not enabled by default and Fedi ask you about notification after login. 
* You can also disable notifications later in any time.
* You can completly remove FCM and Push Relay Usage (or use your own FCM credentials and Push Relay server instance).

### Which data Push Relay server have access?

```
 {
   "access_token""=>""QiQGKu6wAsF6M3bWJ3FMTvfK_rW...",
   "body""=>"@jffdev2: @jffdev hello world",
   "icon""=>""https://fedi.app/images/avi.png",
   "notification_id"=>1114,
   "notification_type""=>""mention",
   "pleroma""=>"{
      "activity_id""=>""A82wvAgZu7n7B...",
      "direct_conversation_id"=>42..
   },
   "preferred_locale""=>""en",
   "title""=>""New Direct Message"
}
```

* As you can see server sent `body` which may have private data (like private Status body) and `access_token`
* `access_token` is sensitive data. It is possible to login to your account if someone know `access_token`
* Fedi and Proxy server doesn't actually need `access_token`, because Fedi mobile app already have it once you logged in
* Once Mastodon and Pleroma devs add additional optional argument to `/api/v1/push/subscription` to exclude `access_token` from notification payload.

## Localization

## Feedback

* The best option is to create issue for this repository

## For developers

* Null-safety support
* Feature-based folder structure
* Prefer `StatelessWidget` and async UI update via `StreamBuidler`
* Prefer divide `Widgets` in small sub `Widgets` with `const` constuctor(for better performance) if possible. Provide data to nested elements via `provider`
* Repository pattern. Allmost all network data cached in local SQLite database. UI always display data from single source (network-only or cached) to achive data consistency.

### Flutter version & FVM 

To build Fedi you need Flutter version specified in [`.fvm/fvm_config.json`](.fvm/fvm_config.json) field `flutterSdkVersion`. You can achive this by simple using `flutter version $version` or using FVM

### FVM Flutter Version Management

Fedi uses [FVM(Flutter Version Management)](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm) to clearly specify Flutter version to build app.

Config already done, so you just run `fvm install` in repo folder and configure IDE to use `.fvm/flutter_sdk` folder instead of system Flutter SDK. 

More info you can found in FVM documentation 

### Libraries

- [`moor`](https://pub.dev/packages/moor) is SQLite ORM. For local data cache & offline mode support
- [`hive `](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) is secure and fast storage for preferences
- [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for Dependency Injection
- [`flutter_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_html) for content rendering
- [`rxdart `](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) for reactive programming
- [`pedantic`](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic) & [`dart_code_metrics`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_code_metrics) for better code analyzing. See [`analysis_options.yaml`](analysis_options.yaml) for enabled rules
- [`flutter_cache_manager`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cache_manager) for media caching
- `flutter_intl` for localization via `.arb` files
- A lot of UI-related (like [`pull_to_refresh`](https://pub.dev/packages/pull_to_refresh)) and Platform-dependend (like [`permission_handler`](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler)) libraries
- [`flutter_config`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_config) to config via .env files

You can find full list in [`pubspec.yaml`](./pubspec.yaml) in the repo root where each library have comment why it's used 

### Icons

* Fedi uses vector icons compiled in icon font via [fluttericon.com](https://www.fluttericon.com/)
* folder [icons_export](./icons_export) in repot contains config for [fluttericon.com](https://www.fluttericon.com/)

### Tests

* Fedi have unit-tests for Bussines Logic and Services classes
* Integration & UI tests not implemented yet

### Backlog

* You can explore [Fedi Trello board](https://trello.com/b/kLFe7CEL/fedi) for current progress

### How to build from source

##### Clone repository

`git clone https://github.com/Big-Fig/Fediverse.app`

##### Go to repository folder

`cd Fediverse.app`

##### Install FVM

Install Flutter version used by this project

`fvm install`

##### Copy default .env config

Copy config for `prod` and `dev` flavors

```
cp env_example.env env_prod.env
cp env_example.env env_dev.env
```

Example config disable some features like **Push notifications**. 

To enable **all features** you should change app id, create Firebase project and edit config file (see below).

##### Run

###### Run from command line

`fvm flutter run --flavor dev`

`fvm flutter run --flavor prod`

###### Run from IDE

Specify flavor(`prod` or `dev`) in `Run Configurations`

#### Flavors

There are two flavors. You can use only prod flavor if you don't need special config for development.

###### prod

Used for build for stores

###### dev

Used for development

#### Config

Main purpose of config files is to exclude sensitive data from source control.

Build script uses config from project root folder depends on flavor, so to build app you should have next files in root folder

```
env_prod.env
env_dev.env
```

Those files excluded from source control.

You can find all possible config variables (with comments) at [env_example.env](env_example.env)

#### App ID

#### Push notifications 

##### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

##### Proxy Push Relay Server

#### Crashlytics (catch exceptions)
