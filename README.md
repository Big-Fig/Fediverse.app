## Known issues

- Text not selectable, but you can copy or share whole statuses
- Instances with special chars like `Ã¼` not supported

## Data gathering

App uses only Firebase Crashlytics to gather stacktraces for bugs.

We plan to add option to disable Crashlytics gathering

## Push notifications

* LINK TO PUSH RELAY REPO

Push notifications implemented via Web Push Relay (Proxy) server. 

1. Fedi subscribe to `/api/v1/push/subscription` with `subscription[endpoint]` set to proxy server.
2. Instances send Web push notifications to relay server.
3. Relay server proxy notifications to Fedi app via FCM
4. Fedi display notifications

Notifications are not enabled by default and Fedi ask you about notification after login. You can also disable notifications later in any time.

### Which data Push Relay server have access?

```
 {
   "access_token""=>""QiQGKu6wAsF6M3bWJ3FMTvfK_rW...",
   "body""=>"@jffdev2: @jffdev hello world",
   "icon""=>""https://fedi.app/images/avi.png",
   "notification_id"=>1114,
   "notification_type""=>""mention",
   "pleroma""=>"{
      "activity_id""=>""A82wvAgZu7n7B...",
      "direct_conversation_id"=>42..
   },
   "preferred_locale""=>""en",
   "title""=>""New Direct Message"
}
```

* As you can see server sents `body` which may have private data (like private Status body) and `access_token`
* Fedi and Proxy server doesn't actually need `access_token`, because Fedi mobile app already have it once you logged in
* We plan to ask Mastodon and Pleroma devs to add additional optional argument to `/api/v1/push/subscription` to exclude `access_token` from notification payload. If that don't suit for you shouldn't enable push notification in Fedi
